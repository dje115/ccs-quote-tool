# Hybrid Translation Strategy

## Phase 1: Core Translation (Manual + AI)
- **Critical UI elements**: Manual translation for accuracy
- **Business terminology**: AI translation with human review
- **Dynamic content**: AI translation on-demand

## Phase 2: AI-First Translation
- **All new content**: AI translation with caching
- **User-generated content**: AI translation
- **Reports/PDFs**: AI translation

## Phase 3: Continuous Improvement
- **User feedback**: Improve AI prompts
- **Quality monitoring**: Flag poor translations
- **Learning system**: Improve based on corrections

## Benefits:
✅ Fast implementation (weeks vs. months)
✅ Any language support
✅ Consistent with your AI-first approach
✅ Lower maintenance overhead
✅ Scales with your business
✅ Cost-effective

## Implementation Timeline:
- Week 1: Basic AI translation system
- Week 2: Template integration
- Week 3: Caching and optimization
- Week 4: Testing and refinement

## Cost Comparison:
- Traditional translation: £0.10-0.20 per word
- AI translation: ~£0.001 per word
- 1000 words = £100-200 vs £1
