# Director Information Display - Implementation

## Overview
Active directors and officers information from Companies House is now displayed on customer detail pages, providing immediate visibility of key decision makers.

## What Was Added

### 1. Enhanced Data Collection (`utils/external_data_service.py`)

#### Active Directors Data Extracted:
- **Name** - Full name (title case formatted)
- **Role** - Director, Secretary, LLP Member, etc.
- **Appointed On** - Date of appointment
- **Occupation** - Professional occupation
- **Nationality** - Country of citizenship
- **Country of Residence** - Where they live
- **Date of Birth** - Month/Year (privacy compliant)
- **Service Address** - Business address for correspondence
- **Officer ID** - Unique Companies House identifier

#### Smart Filtering:
- ✅ Automatically excludes resigned officers (only active shown)
- ✅ Limits to top 10 officers in API response
- ✅ Filters out officers with `resigned_on` dates

### 2. AI Integration (`utils/customer_intelligence.py`)

Director information is automatically included in AI analysis prompts:
```
Active Directors/Officers (3):

1. John Smith
   Role: Director
   Appointed: 2015-03-15
   Occupation: IT Consultant
   Nationality: British
   Residence: UK
   Age: Born 05/1978
```

This allows GPT-5 to:
- Identify key decision makers
- Assess director experience and backgrounds
- Evaluate company stability (director tenure)
- Understand company structure

### 3. Customer Detail Page Display (`templates/crm/customer_detail.html`)

#### Visual Display Features:

**Card-Based Layout:**
- Shows up to 6 directors in grid format (2 columns)
- Each director in their own card with full information

**Information Shown:**
- Name (as heading)
- Role badge (Director, Secretary, etc.)
- Occupation with briefcase icon
- Appointment date with calendar icon

**"View All" Button:**
- If more than 6 directors, shows "View All X Directors" button
- Opens modal with complete list
- Modal shows ALL directors with full details in expandable cards

#### Modal Display:
When clicking "View All Directors":
- Shows numbered list of ALL active directors

### When Directors Appear:

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:
```
Companies House API
    ↓
_get_detailed_accounts_info()
    ↓
Extract active_directors list
    ↓
Store in companies_house_data JSON
    ↓
Pass to AI analysis prompt
    ↓
Display on customer detail page
    ↓
Modal for full list
```

### JSON Structure:
```json
{
  "accounts_detail": {
    "active_directors": [
      {
        "name": "John Smith",
        "role": "Director",
        "appointed_on": "2015-03-15",
        "occupation": "IT Consultant",
        "nationality": "British",
        "country_of_residence": "UK",
        "date_of_birth": "05/1978",
        "address": "123 Business St, London, SW1A 1AA"
      }
    ],
    "total_active_directors": 3
  }
}
```

### Template Logic:
```jinja2
{% if customer.companies_house_data %}
{% set ch_data = customer.companies_house_data|from_json %}
{% if ch_data.get('accounts_detail') and ch_data['accounts_detail'].get('active_directors') %}
    <!-- Display directors -->
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
```
