# Lead Generation - How to Use & What to Expect

## Overview
The lead generation system uses GPT-5's web search capability to find REAL UK businesses that match your campaign criteria.

## How It Works

### 1. Click "Run Campaign"
When you click the button:
- ‚úÖ Button changes to "Running Campaign..." with spinner
- ‚úÖ Page sends request to server
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Page will appear to "hang" for 1-3 minutes** - this is NORMAL
- ‚úÖ Watch terminal/console for detailed progress

### 2. GPT-5 Web Search Process (1-3 minutes)
The system performs these steps:

```
============================================================
STARTING GPT-5 WEB SEARCH FOR CAMPAIGN: MSP in Leicestershire
Postcode: LE1
Distance: 20 miles
Max Results: 50
Campaign Type: it_msp_expansion
============================================================

Making GPT-5 Responses API call with web search...
[GPT-5 searches UK business directories, Companies House, websites...]
[This takes 60-180 seconds depending on complexity]

‚úì GPT-5 Responses API call successful!
‚úì Extracted JSON response (XXXX characters)
‚úì JSON is valid
‚úì Found X businesses in response
```

### 3. Lead Creation & Deduplication
After GPT-5 returns results:
```
Creating lead: Example IT Ltd
‚úì Created lead for Example IT Ltd
Checking for duplicates...
‚úì X new leads created
‚úì X duplicates skipped
```

### 4. Page Refreshes
- Flash message appears: "Campaign completed successfully!"
- Lead count updates
- Campaign status changes to "COMPLETED"

## Expected Wait Times

### By Campaign Size:
- **Small (5-10 results)**: 30-60 seconds
- **Medium (10-20 results)**: 60-120 seconds  
- **Large (20-50 results)**: 120-180 seconds

### Why So Long?
GPT-5 with web search:
1. Performs multiple web searches
2. Visits business websites
3. Checks Companies House database
4. Extracts and verifies contact information
5. Cross-references multiple sources
6. Formats results as structured JSON

This is REAL web research, not cached data!

## What to Watch in Terminal

### Successful Run:
```
============================================================
STARTING GPT-5 WEB SEARCH
============================================================

Making GPT-5 Responses API call with web search...

‚úì GPT-5 Responses API call successful!
‚úì Extracted JSON response (12500 characters)
‚úì JSON is valid
‚úì Found 15 businesses in response

Creating lead: ABC IT Services Ltd
Companies House verification for ABC IT Services Ltd
‚úì Created lead for ABC IT Services Ltd

Creating lead: XYZ Technology Ltd  
Companies House verification for XYZ Technology Ltd
‚úì Created lead for XYZ Technology Ltd

... [more leads] ...

Campaign completed: 15 found, 12 created, 3 duplicates
```

### If Using Fallback (No Web Search):
```
Responses API failed, falling back to chat completions: ...
Using GPT-5 knowledge base (no live web search)
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: Page "Hangs" or Appears Frozen
**Status**: ‚úÖ NORMAL BEHAVIOR
**Why**: The request is synchronous - browser waits for server response
**Solution**: Be patient, watch terminal logs for progress
**Duration**: 1-3 minutes depending on campaign size

### Issue: "Responses API failed, falling back..."
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Using fallback method
**Why**: Responses API parameter error or timeout
**Result**: Uses GPT-5 knowledge base instead of live web search
**Quality**: Results may be less accurate/current

### Issue: No leads created (0 results)
**Possible causes**:
1. **Postcode too specific**: Try broader area or increase distance
2. **No matching businesses**: Try different campaign type
3. **API timeout**: Check terminal for error messages
4. **GPT-5 couldn't find verified businesses**: Increase max_results

### Issue: All results are duplicates
**Status**: ‚úÖ Working correctly
**Why**: Businesses already exist in database
**Solution**: 
- Check existing leads before running
- Try different geographic area
- Use different campaign type

## Supported GPT-5 Responses API Parameters

### ‚úÖ What Works:
```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[{"type": "web"}],
    input=[...messages...]
)
```

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work:
- ~~`response_format`~~ - Not supported
- ~~`max_completion_tokens`~~ - Not supported  
- ~~`temperature`~~ - Not supported
- ~~`timeout`~~ - Not supported (use client-level timeout)

## Results Quality

3. Paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini
4. Copy the JSON results
5. Paste back into the application
6. System processes and creates leads

**Benefits**:
