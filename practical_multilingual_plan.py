# RECOMMENDED APPROACH: AI-First Translation

## Current Priority: Continue Feature Development
1. ✅ Complete lead generation improvements
2. ✅ Fix financial data accuracy
3. ✅ Enhance competitor analysis
4. ✅ Improve Google Maps integration
5. ✅ Add more AI analysis features

## When to Add Multilingual: After Core Features
- When you have 10+ happy customers
- When you're ready to expand internationally
- When you have proven product-market fit
- When customers specifically request it

## AI Translation Implementation (When Ready):

### Step 1: Simple Translation Service
```python
class AITranslationService:
    def translate(self, text, target_lang, context="general"):
        # Use GPT-5-mini for fast, cheap translations
        # Cache results in database
        # Handle context-specific terminology
```

### Step 2: Template Integration
```html
<!-- Replace this -->
<h1>Lead Generation Dashboard</h1>

<!-- With this -->
<h1>{{ "Lead Generation Dashboard" | ai_translate(user.language) }}</h1>
```

### Step 3: Dynamic Content Translation
- AI analysis results
- Generated reports
- Email templates
- PDF documents

## Advantages of This Approach:
✅ No development slowdown now
✅ Can support ANY language instantly
✅ Consistent with your AI-first strategy
✅ Much cheaper than human translators
✅ Faster to implement
✅ Easier to maintain
✅ Scales automatically

## When You're Ready (2-3 months):
1. Add translation service (1 week)
2. Update templates (1 week)
3. Add language selector (2 days)
4. Test with 2-3 languages (1 week)
5. Deploy and monitor (ongoing)
