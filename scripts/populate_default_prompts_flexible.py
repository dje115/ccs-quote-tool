Analyze this project and create a comprehensive quotation. Read the project description carefully and identify what is actually being requested.

**Project Details:**
Project Title: {project_title}
Description: {project_description}
Building Type: {building_type}
Building Size: {building_size} sqm
Number of Floors: {number_of_floors}
Number of Rooms/Areas: {number_of_rooms}
Site Address: {site_address}

**Requirements:**
- WiFi installation: {wifi_requirements}
- CCTV installation: {cctv_requirements}
- Door entry installation: {door_entry_requirements}
- Special requirements: {special_requirements}

**Labour Rate:** Â£300 per pair of engineers per day (8-hour day)

**Analysis Instructions:**
1. READ THE PROJECT DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY - don't make assumptions
2. Identify what is actually being requested (WiFi, CCTV, door entry, cabling, or combination)
3. Calculate materials and labour based on the actual requirements
4. Recommend specific products with pricing when possible
5. Ask clarification questions if critical details are missing
6. Consider all technical requirements and constraints

**For Different Project Types:**
- **WiFi Projects**: Include access points, controllers, cabling, power requirements
- **CCTV Projects**: Include cameras, recorders, monitors, cabling, storage
- **Door Entry Projects**: Include access control, readers, locks, cabling, software
- **Structured Cabling**: Include cables, connectors, face plates, patch panels, cabinets
- **Combined Projects**: Include all relevant systems and their integration

**Technical Guidelines:**
- For structured cabling: Twin outlets = 2 connections, Quad outlets = 4 connections
- For WiFi: Consider coverage areas, access point placement, cabling requirements
- For CCTV: Consider camera types, recording requirements, storage needs
- For door entry: Consider access points, user management, integration needs
- Always consider distance limits for copper cabling (100m) and recommend fiber for longer runs
- Include all necessary materials: cables, connectors, face plates, back boxes, patch panels, equipment, etc.

**Return comprehensive JSON with ALL relevant information:**
